This repository contains the Power BI project for analyzing and visualizing product sales data. The project aims to provide valuable insights into sales performance, trends, and other key metrics.

## Project Overview

In this project, I use Microsoft Power BI to process, analyze, and visualize product sales data. The workflow includes data loading, transformation, relationship building, and creating insightful visualizations.

   - Performed other necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Relationship Building**:
   - Established connections between different tables in the dataset to enable cross-table analysis.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created various visualizations based on the project requirements.
   - Designed an interactive dashboard for easy data exploration.

5. **Measure Creation**:
   - Developed custom measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate specific metrics required for the analysis.
